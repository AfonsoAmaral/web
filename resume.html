            <h2><br><br>Economic perspective</h2>
            <p><br>I have been helping to <strong>build capabilities within the European Commission</strong> to monitor the impact of Supply Chain disruptions. <br><br> Together with the Commission's Chief Economist Team, I have built an early warning mechanism to <strong>monitor supply chain disruptions</strong>. <br> Currently, we are working on extending such tool to assess possible supply chain disruptions in net-zero Green Technologies: <br><i>Photo Voltaics Solar Panels, Wind Turbines (onshore and Offshore), Electrical Vehicles Batteries, Heat Pumps, and Fuel Cells and Hydrogen electrolysers</i><br> <br></p>

      <div class="content">
        <p><em><small> <br> In collaboration with the European Commission, I have contributed to the development indicator-based mechanism to monitor the evolution of supply chains in the European Union (EU) and identify potential distresses. Current events, such as COVID-19 or the Russian aggression against Ukraine, have highlighted the need for a better risk assessment of supply chains, particularly in strategic areas, with the ultimate goal of detecting disruptions as early as possible to avoid potential adverse effects on the economy and society. <br> <br> The proposed monitoring system is entitled “SCAN” (Supply Chain Alert Notification) and its main goal is to identify significant inflationary pressures and/or shortages, resulting from imbalances between demand and supply. This data-driven system could alert policy makers on possible supply chain disruptions, which can occur for specific products and sectors. <br> <br> The SCAN is first applied at the product level, where supply chain disruptions start to materialise. In order to be able to have targeted conclusions, we illustrate how this mechanism performs by focusing on a set of important commodities in two strategic settings – i.e. production of solar panels, commodities affected by the Russian invasion. The SCAN is then applied for the universe of sectors to capture signals of distress with more important aggregate consequences. </small></em></p>

      <p><small><i><br>In this study, I investigate the relationship between technological diversity and the existing number of firms within a technologically advanced industry. I use the several shocks in the mechanical ventilator market during COVID-19 pandemic (sharp rise in demand, supply chain constraints, regulatory change) that resulted in a massive increase in the new entrants’ pool to analyze the technological advances brought up by this exogenous increase in the number of firms. I show that the entrance of these new firms brought up new approaches to innovation further boosting technological progress.</small></i></p>
