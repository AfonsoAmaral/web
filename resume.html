        <p><em><small>In this work, we propose a policy framework to support economic dynamism and manufacturing flexibility that makes use of the full suite of local and regional as well as national policy mechanisms, from acting as central repositories of information and validation to contracts and procurements, through regulatory flexibility and street-level bureaucrats to appropriately incentivize both pre-crisis and during crises investments in flexibility among firms of all sizes, taking advantage of the specific strengths and weaknesses of firms of different sizes</small></em></p>

              <p><em><small>From my field-work in the mechanical ventilator market, I develop an Industrial Policy framework for policy makers to leverage new pathways to tackle the challenges firms must overcome to penetrate new markets. Such framework consists of five dimensions of firms’ capabilities relevant to their innovation process of technologically advanced products high in tacit knowledge: Manufacturing capabilities, Regulatory expertise, Market-specific knowledge, Supply-chain insights, and Technological Capacity to innovate.</small></em></p> <br>

              <p><em><small>In this study, I investigate the relationship between technological diversity and the existing number of firms within a technologically advanced industry. I use the several shocks in the mechanical ventilator market during COVID-19 pandemic (sharp rise in demand, supply chain constraints, regulatory change) that resulted in a massive increase in the new entrants’ pool to analyze the technological advances brought up by this exogenous increase in the number of firms. I show that the entrance of these new firms brought up new approaches to innovation further boosting technological progress.</small></em></p><br>

          <li> <p> <i>The extent to which domestic industrial capabilities are essential in contributing to a Nations’ prosperity and national well being is the topic of long-standing debate. On the one hand, globalization and production outsourcing can lead to greater productivity, lower product costs, and gains from trade. On the other hand, national capabilities have long been a source of competitiveness and security during times of war and other crises.</i></p></li>
          <li> <p> We explore the importance of domestic industrial capabilities during crises through a comparative case study of two countries - Spain and Portugal - to the sudden spike in demand for the manufacture of mechanical ventilators brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic. </p></li>
          <li> <p> To unpack the processes used by each country we leverage insights from 60 semi-structured interviews across experts from industry, healthcare workers, regulators, non-profit organizations, and research centers. We find that Spanish regulatory measures were more effective, resulting in 12 times more approvals. </p></li>
          <li> <p>  We find that Spanish regulatory measures were more effective, resulting in 12 times more approvals and we conclude by proposing new theory for how nations might identify important core competencies to enhance their dynamic (regulatory) capabilities in areas likely to be critical to their social welfare.</p></li>

          <p></p> In my work with the European Commission, I have contributed to the development of an early warning mechanism to monitor supply chains. Currently, we are working on extending such tool to assess possible supply chain disruptions in four different technologies: <i>Semi-conductors, Solar Panels, Wind, Electrical Vehicles Batteries</i><br> <br>

This mechanism is implemented at two levels, sectorial and product level. The developed indicators are used by combining four different data sources, Business and Consumer surveys and Short-Term Business Statistics for sectorial level monitoring as well as customs data and PRODCOM for product-level monitoring.</small></em></p>
