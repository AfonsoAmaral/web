              <p><em><small>In this work, we propose a policy framework to support economic dynamism and manufacturing flexibility that makes use of the full suite of local and regional as well as national policy mechanisms, from acting as central repositories of information and validation to contracts and procurements, through regulatory flexibility and street-level bureaucrats to appropriately incentivize both pre-crisis and during crises investments in flexibility among firms of all sizes, taking advantage of the specific strengths and weaknesses of firms of different sizes</small></em></p>

              <p><em><small>From my field-work in the mechanical ventilator market, I develop an Industrial Policy framework for policy makers to leverage new pathways to tackle the challenges firms must overcome to penetrate new markets.

I show that the entrance of these new firms brought up new approaches to innovation further boosting technological progress.</small></em></p><br>

            <h4><strong> Manufacturing Flexibility by Industry 4.0 Technological Concepts:</strong></h4> <h5>Impact and Assessment </h5>
            <div class="resume-item pb-0">
              <p><em><small>Industry 4.0 is expected deliver a greater flexibility to the worldwide industrial sector together with the highest quality standards in engineering, planning, manufacturing, operational, and logistic processes. Literature to-date already contemplates tools to help companies endure in I4.0 endeavor or real-case examples of technological implementation to demonstrate that companies’ I4.0 entry barriers might not be as high as they initially may appear, but currently, it is lacking a method that allows for a systematic assessing the profitability of technological concepts of I4.0 under explicit consideration of the affected flexibility. This article intends to fill this gap in the literature by proposing a decision theory-based procedure model for the evaluation of I4.0 solutions. That is, a model that enables a transparent assessment which is tailored to the different technological concepts of I4.0 as well as the affected types of flexibility (available, needed).</small></em></p>

            <h3 class="resume-title"> <strong>Master’s research</strong></h3> <h4>Industry 4.0 maturity model for Small and Medium Enterprises</h4>
            <p>In my Master’s work, I have specialized in Industry 4.0 maturity models and implementation of critical technologies in Small and Medium Enterprises, their integration in Industry 4.0, and how these companies can shape themselves to reap the full benefits of their inherent digital transformation. <br> I was a researcher for 9 months in the cooperative research program “cátedra 4.0” between Instituto Superior Técnico and <a href = "http://en.thenavigatorcompany.com/" target = "_blank">The Navigator Company</a>. All of my work was done under the supervision and guidance of Professor Paulo Peças, professor at Instituto Superior Técnico, and co-founder of engineering-consulting firm, <a href = "https://erising.pt/?lang=en" target = "_blank"> Erising</a> <br> <br>
              From this effort, I have successfully <strong>published 4 articles</strong> in academic international journals. I have initially published an article looking at the state-of-the-art literature on Industry 4.0 maturity models, highlighting their flaws, and proposing a <a href = "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/339811740_SMALL_MEDIUM_ENTERPRISES_AND_INDUSTRY_40_CURRENT_MODELS%27_INEPTITUDE_AND_THE_PROPOSAL_OF_A_METHODOLOGY_TO_SUCCESSFULLY_IMPLEMENT_INDUSTRY_40_IN_SMALL_MEDIUM_ENTERPRISES" target = "_blank"> methodology</a> to build an Industry 4.0 maturity model that targets Small and Medium Enterprises (SME). I have followed the same methodology I proposed and built such <a href = "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/352853218_A_Framework_for_Assessing_Manufacturing_SMEs_Industry_40_Maturity" target = "_blank">Industry 4.0 maturity model</a> focused on SMEs. I have, meanwhile implements one of the most known Industry 4.0 maturity models and showed how these models can be used by <a href = "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/346727634_SMEs_and_Industry_40_Two_case_studies_of_digitalization_for_a_smoother_integration" target = "_blank">proposing technology implementation</a> [proposing technology implementation] in two processes of a technological laggard. Leveraging blue-color work from a colleague in my research group at the time, we have shown the impact that Industry can have on <a href = "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/362428370_Lean_methods_digitization_towards_lean_40_a_case_study_of_e-VMB_and_e-SMED" target = "_blank">working-method philosophies</a> such as Lean management. Lastly, I have spent some time studying firms manufacturing flexibility and how the implementation of Industry 4.0 technologies might affect it.</p>
